* Description
  This is a javascript library that defines and implements an API for
  drawing vectors of data in the context of statistical graphics. It
  is inspired by the qtpaint package. Currently, there is only one
  implementation based on the <canvas> 2D context. It has not been
  tested yet. Once it is working, a WebGL implementation will follow.

* Building
  Although the functionality is not yet tested, it is possible to
  build the library into an optimized file for loading in a
  browser. These are the steps:
  1. Install node.js on the system.
  2. Install the grunt build tool CLI: =npm install -g grunt-cli=
  3. Install the dependencies of the build system, from within the
     root directory of the repository: =npm install=
  4. Build the optimized distribution script: =grunt=

  Currently, that last step depends on having a patched version of
  the =grunt-bower-hooks= package. Hopefully, that issue will be
  resolved soon.
